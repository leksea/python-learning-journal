# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey


## About Me ##
I have a strong academic foundation in **Applied Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science**, and began my career as a **Data Engineer and Junior Software Engineer** at Wärtsilä before relocating to the U.S.

For the past decade, I worked at **Stanford University** as a **research neuroscientist** in a vision lab, where I specialized in **high-density EEG data collection and analysis**. I also developed and maintained **custom EDA pipelines** used across multiple research teams. In addition, I designed and implemented **visual stimulus paradigms** for both my own experiments and those of my colleagues.

Most recently, I completed the **Data Science program at Flatiron School**, further solidifying my skills in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data-driven research.
